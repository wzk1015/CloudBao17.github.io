I completed my undergraduate studies at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, specializing in Automation and Information Technology, where my primary research interests were signal processing and intelligent hardware design. I then pursued a master's degree at the Reid School of Music, University of Edinburgh, specializing in Sound Design. My studies there encompassed composition, film scoring, interactive music design, and audio programming. During this period, I encountered AI music, an emerging research field that has piqued the curiosity and confusion of many, including myself. One significant challenge I have identified in this field is the lack of effective communication between AI engineers and musicians. From my perspective, meaningful research and valuable products in this field can only result from collaborative efforts, not from working in isolation. Therefore, I have been dedicated to bridging this gap by leveraging my connections to foster joint research and exploration efforts.

Currently, I am engaged in research related to symbolic music generation, aiming to produce work that truly benefits musicians, rather than merely post some papers into conferences. Simultaneously, I am actively exploring the possibilities within interactive music design. This is driven by my belief that most musical styles have evolved due to technological advancements of their times, such as the invention of some instruments leading to the Baroque style, and analog circuit technology leading to rock music with distorted electric guitar sounds. Therefore, I am convinced that the advanced development of AI and interactive technologies today will inevitably lead to a new musical style and performance techniques, offering audiences a more sophisticated visual and auditory experience.

Presently, I am a research assistant at MBZUAI in the UAE, under the supervision of the well-known AI music researcher, Professor Gus Xia. In my personal time, I am an independent musician and film score composer, occasionally releasing original songs and compositions. I have collaborated with directors from Hong Kong and Beijing and have received several awards for my work. Lastly, I am also a double bass/electric bass player. I have toured extensively across China with the Imperial 9 orchestra. I and three friends from different countries also formed a band called The Population Explosion during my time in Edinburgh, performing commercially at various livehouses in the city.
